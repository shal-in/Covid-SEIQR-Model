# Covid-19 Cellular Automata Model

This repository contains a Python implementation of a SEIQR Cellular Automata model, which aims to simulate and analyze the spread of a respiratory virus within a population. The model is specifically designed to provide detailed insights into the development and transmission dynamics of the highly transmissible and deadly SARS-CoV2 virus, which has caused a global pandemic. The project consists of a single Jupyter Notebook which contains the code to run the report and the actual report in markdown cells.

## Project Structure

This repository is structured as follows:

1. **seiqr.py**: This file contains the implementation of functions necessary to run the SEIQR Cellular Automata model. It includes logic for simulating virus spread, updating individual states, and computing metrics.

2. **SEIQR Cellular Automata Model.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook serves as the main code and analysis hub. It allows running the model, visualizing results, and conducting in-depth analysis.

3. **SEIQR Cellular Automata Model.html**: This HTML file provides a pre-rendered version of the Jupyter Notebook, including both code and report sections, for easy access without running the notebook.

## Running the Notebook

To run the SEIQR Cellular Automata Model notebook, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.

2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository folder.

4. Make sure that the `seiqr.py` file is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.

5. Start Jupyter Notebook by running the command `jupyter notebook`.

6. In the Jupyter Notebook interface that opens in your browser, navigate to the repository folder and open the `SEIQR Cellular Automata Model.ipynb` file.

7. Read the text cells for background information on the model.

8. Execute the code cells by clicking on them and pressing Shift+Enter or clicking the "Run" button.

9. Observe the output and visualizations generated by the model.

10. Modify parameters, experiment with different scenarios, and rerun code cells as desired.

By following these steps, you can run and explore the SEIQR Cellular Automata Model in the Jupyter Notebook environment, gaining insights into virus spread dynamics and the impact of different parameters on the simulation results. Ensure that the `seiqr.py` file is in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook to ensure proper importing of the model's functions.

## Dependencies

To run the SEIQR Cellular Automata Model, you will need the following dependencies:

- **numpy**: A library for numerical computations in Python.
- **matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating visualizations.
- **seiqr**: The `seiqr.py` file containing the implementation of the SEIQR Cellular Automata model.

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
